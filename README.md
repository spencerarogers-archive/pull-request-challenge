# Pull Request Challenge

In order to get instructions for the next part of the challenge, you need to submit a pull request to this repository with your encrypted email address as the title.

**It is not necessary to use git for this exercise!** All operations can be performed using Github's online interface.

First, perform step 1 of [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to fork this repository (not the spoon-knife repository)

In order to submit a pull request, you must make a modification to your source code. The best way to do that for this exercise is to create a new file with any contents you'd like.

Once you've created a new file in your fork, you need to obtain an encrypted version of your email address here:
[Encryption Form](http://ctf.flatironschool.com/encryption)

We are encrypting the email addresses because these pull requests are public, and we don't want to create a public index of all the Fellow's emails!

Put the encrypted email address in the title field of your pull request:
![Encrypted email in pull request title](http://vfa-tech-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/pull-request-title.png)

If you don't get it right the first time, make a change to the file you created and this will reprocess your pull-request.

Check your email once you accomplish this (you might have to wait a minute for it to arrive).

Good luck!
